## This are the changes affected with this pull request.
1. Added a .json() method to comment and group to aid serialization, other classes will come up in subsequent changes.
2. Deleted  `api/logout.py`, and merged it with login in the `auth/routes.py`.
3. Updated the BBACKEND_DEVs.md file, kindly go thorugh it.
4. Added [documentation_groups](group/documentation_groups.md) and [documentation_events](events/documentation_events.md) for their respective endpoints
5. Registered a blueprint for [groups](app.py), [events](app.py), [auth](app.py) in the [app.py](app.py) File. This way we can all focus on writing only endpoints and not always initializing the flask app on our file.
6. Added `flask-user` to the requirement.txt file, flask-user has a dependency auth-lib, that is needed for google authentication of users.
7. Deleted User-Groups and merged it with [group/routes.py](group/routes.py)
8. Added a method getUser in the [database](models/engine/database.py) to enable checking of user's credentials on the database by using email.
P.S: Can't think of a better less stressful to implement that, if you have an idea on how to do that, create an issue
9. [Login_documentation](auth/LOGIN_DOCUMENTATION.md) and [logout_documentation](auth/LOGIN_DOCUMENTATION.md) where also merged, reviews of their contents will be done shortly.
10. The [api](api) directory is to be left bare till further notice, make use of the given packages for your endpoints.
11. DB session is in `models/engine/database.py`, not `db_connection/connection.py`
12. If you need access to query please read the [DB_documentation](models/Documentation.md) on how to achieve that, don't write ~models.storage.session.query~
13. I also made a change to the __init__ of [database](models/engine/database.py) to create a sqlite db named `sampleEVENTAPP.db`. Help is need to populate it with testing data, pending when we go live. so we can test our endpoints.
# 14. All endpoints on users can be in the `auth/routes.py` 
# 15. All endpoints on things groups in `group/routes.py`
# 16. All endpoints on things evens in `events/routes.py`
17. Endpoints now in respective files in `views`


## The following are the list of endpoint we have

Endpoints have increased than this

1. [Login/Create_user](auth/routes.py): Signup is strictly done by google auth, the payload data's received will be used to login. and subsequesnt logins are operated on by the endpoint.
2. [Logout](auth/routes.py): Signout/Logout endpoint is also available albeit they may be discrepancies due to how the session login token was stored and how they are retrieed by the team working on logout, this discrepancies will be meddled out ASAP.
3. [callback](auth/routes.py): Part o the signup package
4. [Get_comments_on_an_event](events/routes.py): Gets the comments made on a specific event
5. [create_group](group/routes.py): Creates a new group
6. [Update_group](group/routes.py): Updates a group name
7. [Get_users_group](group/routes.py): Gets the groups a specific user is at
