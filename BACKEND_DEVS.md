# Approved file structure.

## All API calls will be writtem in the api folder.

## All models should be in seperate files under the models folder

## The db_connection folder is where we'll connect to the db from. so if you need the db in your implementation just import db from db_connection.

## The settimgs folder contains the config files and other requirements for the backend.

## All authentication should be done in the auth folder.



    you can write different file for each api call, it'll be combined into one file during pull requests.
    Note, only create a new file if the required file is not present during the most Recent pull.
    If you file structure do not follow this procedure, you work will not be accepted nor merged.
